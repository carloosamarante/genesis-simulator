## Dependencies and Technologies used

- __[Npm 6.9.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm/v/6.9.0)__ - This project uses npm as a package manager.
- __[Node-sass 4.12.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass/v/4.12.0)__ - "CSS on its own can be fun, but stylesheets are getting larger, more complex, and harder to maintain. This is where a preprocessor can help. Sass lets you use features that don't exist in CSS yet like variables, nesting, mixins, inheritance and other nifty goodies that make writing CSS fun again."
